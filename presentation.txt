What is a Function?
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
Functions are executed when they are called. This is known as invoking a function.
Values can be passed into functions and used within the function.
Functions always return a value. In JavaScript, if no return value is specified, the function will return undefined.
Functions are objects.
